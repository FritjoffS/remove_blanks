# REMOVE BLANKS

## Simple program for removing blanks in clipboard.

<p> This is a simple Python program for removing blanks in copied text on clipborad.

<p> Starting the program you get a small window with two buttons. One for starting the monitoring and editing of whatever you copy or cut to Windows clipboard. And one for stopping the monitor and editing of the clipboard.

<p> From here I want to work on the GUI, learning more about customizing the colours and shapes.
<p> Also adding a controlpanel for customizing the editing, adding diffrent caracters to delete or change.
